Header:

Displays the main title of the site ("Online Courses.com") and a navigation menu linking to different sections: Courses, Contact, and About Us.
Main Content:

Courses Section:
Contains individual course cards for each offering. Each card includes:
An image representing the course.
The course title and a brief description.
The price, including a discounted price displayed with strikethrough for emphasis.
A "Buy Now" button that triggers an alert to indicate the course has been added to the cart when clicked.
Footer:

Provides contact information, including an email address and phone number, and includes copyright information.
Functionality:
Each course card has an onclick event that displays an alert when the user attempts to purchase a course.
The use of inline CSS styles for quick formatting of buttons and images.
Accessibility and Usability:
The code includes alt attributes for images to improve accessibility for screen readers.
Clear, organized structure with semantic HTML elements for better SEO and maintainability.
Technologies Used:
HTML for structure and content.
Inline CSS for styling elements (although it's recommended to move styling to a separate CSS file for better practices).
Potential Improvements:
Move inline styles to an external stylesheet (jerry.css) for better maintainability.
Implement real cart functionality instead of simple alerts.
Enhance accessibility features and mobile responsiveness.
This code serves as a foundational template for an online course marketplace, designed to be both functional and easy to navigate.
